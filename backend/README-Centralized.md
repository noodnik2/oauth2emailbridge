# Centralized OAuth2 Token Authority

A significant clarification gained from carrying out this PoC is the realization of the
need for ... _something else_...

## Registration Nightmare!

For an important use case in which a vendor provides software installed locally at each of
its more than 100 customer locations, an inordinately high installation and support cost
would be required for managing the needed OAuth2 registrations across all of desired
e-mail providers (e.g., Gmail, Outlook mail, etc.).  In this case, each customer site
would need to create and maintain its own OAuth2 registration (i.e., to obtain the needed
"client id", "client secret", "callback URL" values, etc.)  The vendor does not have
agency - or desire - to provide the manpower, expertise or guidance needed at each
customer site needed for this purpose.

As a potential solution to help reduce this additional burden for installation and 
management, leverage of a centralized OAuth2 server (such as one which could be 
created with the help of [Auth0]) is proposed.

While each customer in the modified scenario will (still) need to register their site
for use with OAuth2, the setup and management process for that would be carried out in
a _centralized_ location (i.e., within the cloud) managed by the vendor.  That process
could be streamlined and documented by the vendor, in a consistent way, for providing
access to email across all email providers supported by the vendor application.

Another group of seemingly relevant toolsets which might help in accomplishing
this goal:

- [Auth0] - [auth0 GitHub](https://github.com/auth0)
- [Gluu] - [GluuFederation](https://github.com/GluuFederation)
- [OpenID] - [openid GitHub](https://github.com/openid)

### Ideation

An example of a centralized solution could be initiated from the
[Auth0 Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/dashboard).  From there, a new "Application"
could be created into which a "social connection" for each email provider (e.g., one for
Google, one for Microsoft) would be added.  For each of these email provider connections,
the OAuth2 registration details would be entered (e.g., the relevant OAuth2 `scope` values
needed by our application).

The PoC client would then use [Auth0] as its (only needed) OAuth2 server, sending a `scope`
value of `openid profile` (selecting `OpenID` functionality), enabling the end-user to
authenticate using their choice of the configured email provider connections (per above).

Once the user session is authenticated, the _Token ID_ value returned by `OpenID` will enable 
the PoC client to know which email provider is authorized, and therefore which APIs to use
for accessing the user's e-mail.

#### Sequence Overview using `Auth0`
